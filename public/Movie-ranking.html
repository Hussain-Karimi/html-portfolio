<h1>The best movies according to Hussain Karimi</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies that came to mind</h2>

<hr />

<h3>What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)</h3>
<p>
    This movie is such a vibe and I felt cozy as I was watching it.
    It's the story of a family which have many problems and the way that story goes,
    it shows a lot of things like love, strugle,
    heart breaks, and etc.
    I recommend it to all of you to watch it.
</p>

<h3>Wild Robot (2024)</h3>
<p>
    An animated movie which melted my heart and gave me the feeling that I hadn't felt in a long long time.
    Such a beautiful, heart warming movie it is.
    If you have a family which you want to set and watch a movie together,
    I recommend it to you!
</p>

<h3>Green Book (2019)</h3>
<p>
    A great and true story that make you think about humanity a lot.
    It gave me chills to see a story of two totally diffirent poeple who find it hard at first to came along but when they do,
    It's beautiful and enjoyable.
    I want everybody to watch it, Everybody!
